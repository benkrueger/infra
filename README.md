# infra
My infrastructure projects

## What this is
This is all the infrastructure as code I use in my homelab/projects/cloud setups. The vast majority of these 
scripts/playbooks/etc will be centered around debian based linux distros.

## How it is organized
Each branch of this repo is a different host. To deploy to a host I switch to the relevant branch and run the code.
The main branch is literally just this readme, maybe some shared code if that becomes possible.
